# Tasks for Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures classes
This repository contains implementation of 5 well-known algorithms:
1. Boyer-Moore - efficient string-searching algorithm.
2. Floyd-Warshall - algorithm for finding shortest paths in weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.
3. Ford-Fulkerson - greedy algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network.
4. Graham's scan - method of finding the convex hull of a finite set of points.
5. Huffman coding - method of implementation of lossless data compression.
